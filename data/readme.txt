The dataset was obtained using a motion capture system. The raw data has been smoothed with a filter, and only the middle section of the motion data has been retained. 
The middle section was chosen because the data at both ends might be influenced by disturbances caused by the release of the RGBlimp and ground effect when approaching the field boundaries.
